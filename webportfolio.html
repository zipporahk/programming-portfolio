    <h1>Programming Portfolio For Zipporah Korir. </h1>

     <p>Greetings to all,</p>
     <p>Welcome to my Programming Portfolio webpage.</p>

     <h2> About ME!!</h2>

     <img src="fem.jpeg" alt="a photo depicting the inner feminine me">

     <p> Hello again. My name is Zipporah Korir. i am 23 years old and i live with my parents in Nairobi. I study at University of Nairobi and also at Moringa School.<p>
     <p> I am currently on break from my studies and therefore chose to start programming to be able to obtain a new skill. With all the news about how we as a planet, are all looking to artificial intelligence it makes sense to have a background in the language of coding.<p>

     <p> I call myself a jigsaw as i enjoy doing many different things i enjoy doing, such as:</p>
     <ol>
       <li> watching the sun rise and set.</li>
       <li> sing and shout...Haha!</li>
       <li> going to meditate in nature </li>
       <li> long drives on roads with beautiful scenery</li>
     </ol>
     <p> I cant wait to further improve myself and here are some links to projects i have already attempted: <p>
